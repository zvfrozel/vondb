Find all pairs of positive integers
$m, n \ge 3$ for which there exist infinitely many
positive integers $a$ such that
\[ \frac{a^m+a-1}{a^n+a^2-1} \]
is itself an integer.

The condition is equivalent to $a^n+a^2-1$
dividing $a^m+a-1$ as polynomials.
The big step is the following analytic one.

\begin{claim*}
  We must have $m \le 2n$.
\end{claim*}
\begin{proof}
  Assume on contrary $m > 2n$
  and let $0 < r < 1$ be the unique real number
  with $r^n+r^2 = 1$, hence $r^m+r = 1$.
  But now
  \begin{align*}
    0 &= r^m + r - 1 < r(r^n)^2 + r - 1 = r\left( (1-r^2)^2+1 \right) - 1 \\
    &= -(1-r)\left( r^4+r^3-r^2-r+1 \right).
  \end{align*}
  As $1-r > 0$ and $r^4+r^3-r^2-r+1 > 0$, this is a contradiction
\end{proof}

Now for the algebraic part.
Obviously $m > n$.
\begin{align*}
  a^n+a^2-1 &\mid a^m+a-1 \\
  \iff a^n+a^2-1 &\mid (a^m+a-1)(a+1) = a^m(a+1) + (a^2-1)  \\
  \iff a^n+a^2-1 &\mid a^m(a+1) - a^n \\
  \iff a^n+a^2-1 &\mid a^{m-n}(a+1) - 1.
\end{align*}
The right-hand side has degree $m-n+1 \le n+1$,
and the leading coefficients are both $+1$.
So the only possible situations are
\begin{align*}
  a^{m-n}(a+1) - 1 &= (a+1)\left( a^n+a^2-1 \right) \\
  a^{m-n}(a+1) + 1 &=  a^n+a^2-1.
\end{align*}
The former fails by just taking $a=-1$;
the latter implies $(m,n) = (5,3)$.
As our work was reversible, this also implies $(m,n) = (5,3)$ works, done.
