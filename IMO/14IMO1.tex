Let $a_0 < a_1 < a_2 < \dotsb$ be an infinite sequence of positive integers.
Prove that there exists a unique integer $n\geq 1$ such that
\[ a_n < \frac{a_0+a_1+a_2+\dotsb+a_n}{n} \le a_{n+1}. \]

Fedor Petrov presents the following nice solution.
Let us define the sequence
\[ b_n = \left( a_n - a_{n-1} \right) + \dots
  + \left( a_n - a_1 \right). \]
Since $(a_i)_i$ is increasing,
this sequence is unbounded, and moreover $b_1 = 0$.
The problem requires an $n$ such that
\[ b_n < a_0 \le b_{n+1} \]
which obviously exists and is unique.

Trivial enough that I won't bother writing it out.
Basically if you assume that no such $n$ exists, then you get $a_m < \frac{a_0+a_1+ \dots + a_m}{m}$ for all $m$. But
\[ a_m < \frac{a_0+ \dots + a_m}{m} \le \frac{a_0+a_1 + (m-1)a_m}{m} \]
which breaks the strictly increasing condition.
Then, once you find a minimal working $n$, just show that no other $n$ work.
