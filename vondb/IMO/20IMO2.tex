The real numbers $a, b, c, d$
are such that $a\geq b\geq c\geq d>0$ and $a+b+c+d=1$.
Prove that
\[ (a+2b+3c+4d) a^a b^b c^c d^d < 1. \]

By weighted AM-GM we have
\[ a^a b^b c^c d^d \le \sum_{\text{cyc}} \frac{a}{a+b+c+d} \cdot a
  = a^2+b^2+c^2+d^2. \]
Consequently, it is enough to prove that
\[ (a^2+b^2+c^2+d^2)(a+2b+3c+4d) \le 1 = (a+b+c+d)^3. \]
Expand both sides to get
\[
  \begin{array}{cccc}
    +a^3 &+ b^2a &+ c^2a & +d^2a \\
    +2a^2b &+ 2b^3 &+ 2b^2c  & +2d^2b \\
    +3a^2c & + 3b^2c & + 3c^3 & + 3d^2c \\
    +4a^2d &+ 4b^2d & + 4c^2d & + 4d^3
  \end{array}
  <
  \begin{array}{cccc}
    +a^3 &+ 3b^2a &+ 3c^2a & +3d^2a \\
    +3a^2b &+ b^3 &+ 3b^2c  & +3d^2b \\
    +3a^2c &+ 3b^2c &+ c^3 &+ 3d^2c \\
    +3a^2d &+ 3b^2d &+ 3c^2d &+ d^3 \\
    +6abc &+ 6bcd &+ 6cda &+ 6dab
  \end{array}
\]
In other words, we need to prove that
\[
  \begin{array}{cccc}
    & && \\
    &+ b^3 & & \\
    & & +2c^3 & \\
    +a^2d &+ b^2d & + c^2d & + 3d^3 \\
  \end{array}
  <
  \begin{array}{cccc}
    &+ 2b^2a &+ 2c^2a & +2d^2a \\
    +a^2b & &+ b^2c  & +d^2b \\
    &&& \\
    &&& \\
    +6abc &+ 6bcd &+ 6cda &+ 6dab
  \end{array}
\]

This follows since
\begin{align*}
  2b^2a &\ge b^3 + c^2d \\
  2c^2a &\ge 2c^3 \\
  2d^2a &\ge 2d^3  \\
  a^2b &\ge a^2d \\
  b^2c &\ge b^2d \\
  d^2b &\ge d^3
\end{align*}
and $6(abc+bcd+cda+dab) > 0$.

\begin{remark*}
  Fedor Petrov provides the following motivational comments
  for why the existence of this solution is not surprising:
  \begin{quote}
    Better to think about mathematics.
    You have to bound from above a product $(a+2b+3c+4d)(a^2+b^2+c^2+d^2)$,
    the coefficients $1,2,3,4$ are increasing and so play on your side,
    so plausibly $(a+b+c+d)^3$ should majorize this term-wise,
    you check it and this appears to be true.
