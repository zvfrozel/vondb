Let $a$, $b$, $c$ be positive reals. Prove that
\[ \frac{a}{\sqrt{a^2+8bc}} + \frac{b}{\sqrt{b^2+8ca}} + \frac{c}{\sqrt{c^2+8ab}} \ge 1. \]

By Holder, we have
\[
  \left( \sum_{\text{cyc}} \frac{a}{\sqrt{a^2+8bc}} \right)^2
  \left( \sum_{\text{cyc}} a(a^2+8bc) \right)
  \ge (a+b+c)^3.
\]
So it suffices to show $(a+b+c)^3 \ge a^3+b^3+c^3+24abc$ which is clear by expanding.

There are a few ways to set up, but
the general idea is to use H\"{o}lder in the form
\[
  \left( \sum_{\text{cyc}} \frac{a}{\sqrt{a^2+8bc}} \right)^p
  \left( \sum_{\text{cyc}} {?}  \right)^q
  \ge \left( \sum_{\text{cyc}} {?} \right)^{p+q}
\]
for some choice of weights $p$ and $q$ to eliminate the radicals
and get a polynomial inequality.
\begin{walk}
  \ii Pick a choice of weights $p, q > 0$ eliminate the radicals.
  \ii Decide on values to fill in the $?$ above.
  (You probably want to eliminate the denominator,
  i.e.\ the left sum should be some multiple of $a^2+8bc$.)
  \ii Try to prove the resulting inequality.
  Depending on what choices you made in (a) or (b),
  this may be relatively easy,
  or it may be impossible (because the inequality may not even be true.)
\end{walk}
