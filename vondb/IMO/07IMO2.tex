Consider five points $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$ and $E$
such that $ABCD$ is a parallelogram and $BCED$ is a cyclic quadrilateral.
Let $\ell$ be a line passing through $A$.
Suppose that $\ell$ intersects the interior of the segment $DC$ at $F$
and intersects line $BC$ at $G$.
Suppose also that $EF = EG = EC$.
Prove that $\ell$ is the bisector of angle $ DAB$.

Let $M$, $N$, $P$ denote the midpoints of $\ol{CF}$, $\ol{CG}$, $\ol{AC}$
(noting $P$ is also the midpoint of $\ol{BD}$).

By a homothety at $C$ with ratio $\half$,
we find $\ol{MNP}$ is the image of line $\ell \equiv \ol{AGF}$.

However, since we also have $\ol{EM} \perp \ol{CF}$
and $\ol{EN} \perp \ol{CG}$ (from $EF=EG=EC$)
we conclude $\ol{PMN}$ is the Simson line of $E$ with respect to $\triangle BCD$,
which implies $\ol{EP} \perp \ol{BD}$.
In other words, $\ol{EP}$ is the perpendicular bisector of $\ol{BD}$,
so $E$ is the midpoint of arc $\widehat{BCD}$.

Finally,
\begin{align*}
  \dang(\ol{AB}, \ell) &= \dang(\ol{CD}, \ol{MNP}) = \dang CMN = \dang CEN \\
  &= 90\dg - \dang NCE = 90\dg + \dang ECB
\end{align*}
which means that $\ell$ is parallel to a bisector of $\angle BCD$,
and hence to one of $\angle BAD$.
(Moreover since $F$ lies on the interior of $\ol{CD}$,
it is actually the internal bisector.)
